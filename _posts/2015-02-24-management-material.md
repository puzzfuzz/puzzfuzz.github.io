TODO: Intro 

[Netflix][netflix_deck] sees themselves as a pro sports team who expects nothing but excellence from every roster slot and hire, develop, and cut smartly so they have stars in every position. [Hubspot][hubspot_deck] focuses on "building a company we love" and enabling autonomy by building a culture of trust and hiring only those that strictly meet their core values (**HEART**). [Spotify][spotify_talk_1] [strives][spotify_talk_2] to innovate rapidly by establishing a "Fail-friendly environment" where the focus is on enabling failure recovery instead of prescribing failure avoidance. Riot Games seeks to establish _people_ as a fundamental asset that is discussed in the boardroom alongside IP and business models while growing a culture of like-minded professionals whose personal passions are as deeply aligned as their work ethic.

All of these companies have their own spin on what it means to work there and be a member of their culture but some very interesting commonalities emerged. The single most important take-away is simply: 

> Culture happens, planned or not.

  > "...people trumps all."
  > "In order to do cool things ... it requires, sort of a shift in the mindset and in the balance of power away from the sort of stereotypical _supervisor type_ towards _creating an environment_; an environment where people who are really exceptional at their respective crafts can collaborate really effectively."
  > "Being a manager of knowledge-work requires a different mindset: rather than tasking people with a mindless portion of the overall job, managers have to become something of a support / hybrid coach / motivational leader."
  > "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. **Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea**." - Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Novelist
  > "Some fall into the trap of thinking that the more people we grow to manage, the more pepole work for us -- and that's backwards. The more people we grow to manage, the more people (as managers) _we work for_. The more people whose success we take responsibility _for_. **That's** the role of the modern manager." 
  > "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, they will either fix it or come up with something better. **That's why people matter.**" - Ed Catmull, President & Co-founder of Pixar
