WORK IN PROGRESS - Management and Organizational Theories of Fantastically Successful Software Companies

TODO: Intro 

* [Netflix][netflix_deck] sees themselves as a pro sports team who expects nothing but excellence from every roster slot and hire, develop, and cut smartly so they have stars in every position. 
* [Hubspot][hubspot_deck] focuses on "building a company we love" and enabling autonomy by building a culture of trust and hiring only those that strictly meet their core values (**HEART**). 
* [Spotify][spotify_talk_1] [strives][spotify_talk_2] to innovate rapidly by establishing a "Fail-Friendly Environment" where the focus is on _enabling failure recovery_ instead of _prescribing failure avoidance_. 
* Riot Games [seeks][riot_talk] to establish _people_ as a fundamental asset that is discussed in the boardroom alongside IP and business models while growing a culture of like-minded professionals whose personal passions are as deeply aligned as their work ethic.

All of these companies have their own spin on what it means to work there and be a "member of their tribe" but some very interesting commonalities emerged. The single most important take-away is simply: 

> Culture happens, planned or not.



#Notable quotes and points

##[Netflix][netflix_corp]
[Netflix Culture: Freedom & Responsibility][netflix_deck] 

- We Seek Excellence
- Actual company values shown by who gets _rewarded_, _promoted_ or _let go_
- Actual company values are the _behaviors_ and _skills_ that are _valued_ in fellow employees
  - Judgement, Communication, Impact, Curiosity, Innovation, Courage, Passion, Honesty, Selflessness
- Great workplace === stunning colleagues, not lush benefits, catered lunches, etc.

> Adequate performance gets a generous severance package

- We're a _team_, not a family. We're like a **pro sports team** not a kid's recreational team.

> The Managers' **Keeper Test**
> - Which of my people, if they told me were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would i fight hard to keep at Netflix? 
> - The others people should get a generous severance now, so we can open a slot to try to find a star for that role

- However, corporate team roster is fluid (unlike sports team) so internal "cutthroat" or "sink or swim" behavior is rare and not tolerated
- Loyalty is Good as a stabilizer
  - People who have been stars, and hit a bad patch, get a near-term pass because they can be stars again
  - They expect he same: if Netflix hits a _temporary_ bad patch, people should stick it out
  - But unlimited loyalty to a shrinking firm, or to an ineffective employee, is not what we are about
  
> Sustained B-level performance, despite "A for effort", generates a generous severance package, with respect
> Sustained A-level performance, despite minimal effort, is rewarded with more responsibility and great pay

- **Brilliant Jerks** are not tolerated because cost to effective teamwork is too high.
- Insistence on performance because, in procedural work, the best are **2x** better than the average, but in creative work, the best are **10x** better than the average. 
- The Rare Responsible Person is: self motivating, self aware, self disciplined, self improving, acts like a leader, doesn't wait to be told what to do, picks up the trash lying on the floor
- Responsible people **thrive** on freedom and are **worthy** of freedom

Why companies impose process as they grow
![netflix chaos](/assets/netflix_chaos.jpg)

- Growth naturally causes complexity, but often shrinks talent density as need to "staff up quickly" erodes traditional hiring practices
- Process emerges to coral chaos, providing seductive near-term order
- Process optimizes practices for existing market and customers
- Process drives out "curious innovator-mavericks", driving talent density even lower
- **Then market shifts...**
- Low talent density and lack of innovators prevent company from adapting quick enough
- Company grinds painfully into irrelevance

How to avoid the **Process Solution**: 
![netflix growth](/assets/netflix_chaos_free.jpg)

How to: Retain talent density
- Offer top-of-market compensation
- Attract high-value people through freedom to make big impact
- Be demanding about high performance culture

How to: Minimize complexity growth
- Few big products vs. many small ones
- Eliminate distracting complexity
- Be wary of efficiency optimizations that increase complexity and rigidity

> Sometimes long-term simplicity is achieved only through bursts of complexity to rework current systems


##[HubSpot][hubspot_corp]
* [culture deck][hubspot_deck] focuses on "Creating a Company We Love"
* HEART
  * Humble
  * Effective
  * Adaptable
  * Remarkable
  * Transparent

##[Riot][riot_corp]
* CEO Brandom Beck [talks][riot_talk] at length about management philosophy in the creative sector.

> "...people trumps all."

> "In order to do cool things ... it requires, sort of a shift in the mindset and in the balance of power away from the sort of stereotypical **supervisor type** towards **creating an environment**; an environment where people who are really exceptional at their respective crafts can collaborate really effectively."

> "Being a manager of knowledge-work requires a different mindset: rather than tasking people with a mindless portion of the overall job, managers have to become something of a support / hybrid coach / motivational leader."

> "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. **Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea**." - Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Novelist

> "Some fall into the trap of thinking that the more people we grow to manage, the more people work for us -- and that's backwards. The more people we grow to manage, the more people (as managers) **we work for**. The more people whose success we take responsibility **for**. **That's** the role of the modern manager." 

> "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, they will either fix it or come up with something better. **That's why people matter.**" - Ed Catmull, President & Co-founder of Pixar

##[Spotify][spotify_corp]
* Engineering culture [part 1][spotify_talk_1], and [part 2][spotify_talk_2]
  * "Innovation > Predictability"
  * "100% Predictability == 0% Innovation"
  * "You are the culture. Model the behavior you want to see."
