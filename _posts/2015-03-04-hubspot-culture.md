#Engineering Culture - Part 2: HubSpot

In [Part 1][part_1] of my exploration of various successful software companies and their engineering and management philosophies, I reviewed a [culture deck][netflix_deck] published by [Netflix][netflix_corp] back in 2009 which gave a super in-depth view of their ethos. The deck covered everything from management theory to employee compensation. 

In this post I'm going to cover a similar presentation titled [The HubSpot Culture Code][hubspot_deck] published by [HubSpot][hubspot_corp] in 2013. HubSpot covers a lot of the same ground as the Netflix deck, however with their own spin and voice. The commonalities between the two are clear but HubSpot's perspective adds some really interesting variety, mostly focusing on how the company's core mission statement and commitment to its people shape the culture from the inside out.

**Disclaimer:** This series is meant to be more book report than sermon. My goal with these posts is to simply distill the most important details of what a variety of companies value without adding personal commentary.

<a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a>

##Culture is to recruiting as product is to marketing

The first and foremost fact that HubSpot emphasizes is that **culture happens**. It's an inescapable fact that whether planned or not, all companies have a culture. A company has the decision whether to allow the culture to grow organically or cultivate something special. Their take? 

> Why not create a culture we love?

> Lets make the company we always dreamed of. Lets create a company that will be a great place to be **from**. - Reed Hastings & Patty McCord, Netflix

The days of pensions, 9-5, and 30 year tenure are long gone. Today's creative-inventive sector is most comfortable working whenever they want, wherever they want, on whatever their task may be -- as long as they are working with **purpose** and alongside **great colleagues**. Many organizations operate as if they're frozen in time, praising the values of past generations, operating as if **money** is what matters most and amazing people are happy to just have a job.  

> Paychecks matter, but purpose matters **more**, as do the people we work with.

##Mission & Metrics

HubSpot embraces a clear and succinct mission statement which helps to keep everyone on the same page: transform how organizations attract, engage and delight their customers by **making the world inbound**. In doing so, they set a clear vision that allows everyone in the organization make decisions and track success against the same goal. 

If there's ever a question about how to approach a problem, the answer is simply **solve for the customer** in a way that will both delight them and lead to their success. If that's not enough, try both and measure the results. Debates are won by better data, not bigger job titles. 

##Transparency

> Today, power is gained by **sharing knowledge** not hoarding it.

HubSpot believes that hiding information from its employees serves no real purpose other than to give them *less context* in which to make important decisions, which doesn't help anyone. Being unrelentingly transparent **supports smarter behavior and better decisions**. Everything from full company financial (excluding individual compensation of course) and burn-rate to board and management meeting slide decks is openly accessible and aggressively updated on the company wiki. 

**Strategic** topics are openly discussed with a strict **no door** policy when it comes to accessibility of people in the company. In an attempt to circumvent needless politics, most of the organization undergoes a quarterly **seating hack** where office assignments are shuffled semi-randomly. This enforces a mindset of openness and flexibility in the most physical of ways.

##HEART

HubSpot touts themselves as **unreasonably picky** about their hires -- with a culture of **autonomy** and **transparency**, they can't afford not to be. Quality of staff enables trust that employees don't need elaborate policies and procedures and will instead simply **use good judgment** on just about everything. 

> Cheat sheet on good judgment: **customer > company > self**

In the end, **results** are all that matters. Not hours worked, where the work was done, or how much vacation was taken. Ensuring that people will exercise good judgment and can be trusted to produce is what most of the hiring process is devoted to. HubSpot has defined five key attributes that it values in people above all else: 

- **H**umble: Self-aware and respectful.
- **E**ffective: Gets stuff done, measurably moves the needle, immeasurably adds value.
- **A**daptable: Curious and constantly changing -- a life-long learner.
- **R**emarkable: Worthy of being remarked upon; has a super-power that makes them stand out in some way.
- **T**ransparent: Open and honest with others and with themselves.

> We don't just believe in these values. **We bet on them.** We recruit, reward and release people based on these values.

> Compromising on culture is mortgaging the future. It's reasonable to want to hire for skills and experience when the need for help is painfully acute. It's reasonable. But, it's also wrong. **The interest rate on culture debt is crushingly high**.

Similar to Netflix, HubSpot sees themselves as a sports team who hires and cuts to ensure they have stars in ever position. Every new hire should elevate the group and raise the average, not just be another body to delegate work to that you don't have time for.

##Investing in Individual Market Value

> With great people comes great responsibility.

Employees should be as successful as their company and the company should be as proud of the **people** they build as they are of the **product**. To that end, HubSpot invests heavily in personal growth by hosting frequent informational presentations lead by industry experts, while also offering free books and other educational resources. 

> If you're **just** doing your job you're **not** doing your job. 

Career progress is achieved by either being a rockstar individual contributor or providing exceptional support to those who are. Alumni are honored and regular meet-up events are held where startup pitches are reviewed, advice given and general camaraderie is shared.

##Try new things

> We'd rather be failing frequently than never trying new things. 

Being afraid to fail forces people to make **safe** choices, which inevitably pulls the company from **exceptional** to **average**. Constant change, simplification and refinement is seen as a competitive advantage allowing HubSpot to reduce complexity as the company grows. This extends beyond product to the organization as a whole.
 
Process and management should be **refactored** as often as code is. Unused features and unproductive meetings should be pruned regularly so both the product and organization can bask in the clarity of simplicity.

##TL;DR 

The **HubSpot Culture Code** is heavily inspired by the **Neflix Culture Deck** as they value much of the same traits in their employees and management structure. Some key aspects of their culture have allowed HubSpot to remain successful as they grow while also guiding employees towards a positive, effective work environment. 

- Setting a clear **mission** and having a deep commitment to **metrics** provides context for most decisions.
- Whenever possible, **solve for the customer**.
- **Transparency** everywhere legally possible (financials, strategy, decisions).
- Enable **autonomy**, don't impose autocracy.
- It's OK to be **unreasonably picky** when hiring to ensure culture stability and integrity.
- Investing in individual **mastery** increases everyone's **market value** and keeps people happy and motiviated.
- Constantly question the **status quo** and don't be afraid to try new things. 


Overall, transparency and simplicity allows great people to be exceptionally productive while an expectation of excellence provides strict hiring guidelines and enables autonomy and trust in colleagues at all levels.
