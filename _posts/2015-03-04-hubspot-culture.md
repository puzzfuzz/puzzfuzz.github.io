#Engineering Culture - Part 2: HubSpot

In [Part 1][part_1] of my exploration of various successful software companies and their engineering and management philosophies, I reviewed a [culture deck][netflix_deck] published by [Netflix][netflix_corp] back in 2009 which gave a super in-depth view of their ethos. The deck covered everything from management theory to employee compensation. 

In this post I'm going to cover a similar culture deck titled [The HubSpot Culture Code][hubspot_deck] published by [HubSpot][hubspot_corp] in 2013 which was largely inspired by Neflix's transparency in their deck. 

##Culture is to recruiting as product is to marketing

The first and foremost fact that HubSpot emphasizes is that **culture happens**. It's an inescapable fact that whether planned or not, all companies have a culture. The company has the decision whether to allow the culture to grow organically or cultivate something special. Their take? 

> Why not create a culture we love?

> Lets make the company we always dreamed of. Lets create a company that will be a great place to be **from**. - Reed Hastings & Patty McCord, Netflix

The days of pensions, 9-5, and 30 year tenure are long gone. Today's creative-inventive sector is most comfortable working whenever they want, wherever they want, on whatever their task may be -- as long as they are working with **purpose** and alongside **great colleagues**. Many organizations operate as if they're frozen in time, praising the values of past generations, operating as if **money** is what matters most and amazing people are happy to just have a job.  

> Paychecks matter, but purpose matters **more**, as do the people we work with.

##Mission & Metrics

HubSpot embraces a clear and succinct mission statement which helps to keep everyone on the same page: transform how organizations attract, engage and delight their customers by **making the world inbound**. In doing so, they set a clear vision that allows everyone in the organization make decisions and track success against the same goal. 

If there's ever a question about how to approach a problem, the answer is simply **solve for the customer** in a way that will both delight them and lead to their success. If that's not enough, try both and measure the results. Debates should be won by better data, not bigger job titles.
