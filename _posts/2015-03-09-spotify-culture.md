#Engineering Culture - Part 3: Spotify

Parts [1][part_1] and [2][part_2] of my on-going exploration of corporate culture in the tech / startup world focused on a pair of culture decks published by [Netflix][netflix_deck] and [HubSpot][hubspot_deck]. These two presentations focused primarily on the internal culture of their companies and the people that work there. Clarity of mission and dedication to personal excellence and integrity have allowed both of these once-startups to balloon into wildly successful public companies. 

[Spotify][spotify_corp] offers another perspective, this time through a [pair][spotify_talk_1] of [videos][spotify_talk_2] focused _specifically_ on the culture of their engineering group. These videos provide an extremely detailed accounting of the organization and philosophy of their engineering group, but what's most interesting is they talk through the history of how this culture came to be as the company grew. 

**Disclaimer:** This series is meant to be more book report than sermon. My goal with these posts is to simply distill the most important details of what a variety of companies value without adding personal commentary.

##Part 1

[Spotify Engineering Culture (part 1)][spotify_talk_1]

##In the Beginning

> Culture tends to be invisible; we don't notice it because it's there all the time, kind of like the air we breathe.

The primary **purpose** of this presentation is that by **explaining** the culture and helping everyone **understand** the culture, an organization is more likely to **keep** the culture and even **strengthen** it as they grow.

- Initially scrum
- Growth - lots of teams
- Scrum practices are getting in the way, decided to make them optional by team

> Rules are a good start, but then break them when needed

> Agile > Scrum
> Principles > Practices 
> Servant Leaders > Process Masters

Autonomous Squads  (ex. scrum team)
- Small, cross-functional, self-organizing team (< 8 ppl)
- End-to-end ownership feature from design to maintenance
- Long term goals & strategy allow autonomy on implementation details
- Co-habitation allowing for constant collaboration 

##Autonomy is Good

- Motivating
	- Motivated people build better stuff
- Fast
	- Minimize hand-offs and waiting
	- No waiting for "manager approval"
- Scale w/o being bogged down in dependencies and coordination

Squads have individual missions, but are aligned with general product strategy. Like jazz. Be autonomous but don't sub-optimize

##Alignment Enables Autonomy

Alignment and autonomy may seem like different ends of a singular scale, but they really form two **dimensions**.

###Low Alignment, Low Autonomy

Micromanagement culture with no high-level goals. "Shut up and follow orders."

> Management **says**: Build a bridge because I said so.

###High Alignment, Low Autonomy###

Leaders are good at communicating **what problem** needs to be solved, but also explicitly tell people **how** to solve it. 

> Management **says**: "We need to cross the river. Build a bridge."

###High Alignment, High Autonomy### 

Leaders clearly communicate what problems need solving and why, but leave the implementation details up to the team.

> Management **says**: "We need to cross the river, figure out how."

###Low Alignment, High Autonomy### 

Nobody talks to anybody about anything; everyone runs around doing whatever they want.

> Management **thinks**: "I sure hope somebody's working on that river problem." 
> Management **says**: Nothing.
