#Netflix Culture

Way back in 2009 [Netflix][netflix_corp] published a [slide deck][netflix_deck] detailing the inner workings of their corporate culture. In it, they discuss many aspects of what it means to work at Netflix -- everything from management and organizational theory to employee mindset and compensation. I've tried to summarize some of the key thoughts from it but the entire deck is definitely worth a read.

##Freedom & Responsibility

> **We Seek Excellence**
> Our culture focuses on helping us achieve excellence

The central idea of the Netflix ethos is that a great workplace is defined by **stunning colleagues** (as opposed to lush benefits and free sushi lunches). Being demanding with expectations of employees has enabled Netflix to build an organization that embraces individual freedom while creating a highly-complex product stack without the need for excess process, wasting roster slots on support staff, or devolving into chaos.

Netflix prioritizes excellence and performance in their employees when hiring, demanding that candidates are as responsible and good-natured as they are innovative (including a strict **no brilliant jerks** policy). By doing so, this enables a management philosophy of **context-driven autonomy** wherein employees are given the freedom and responsibility to exercise their own judgment over day-to-day activities. 

A [highly-aligned, loosely coupled][slide_93] model for corporate teamwork has management setting clear goals and over-arching strategy while allowing individual teams to come up with their own tactics for execution. Guarantee of employee excellence facilitates **trust between groups** allowing for ad-
hoc communication in lieu of formal approval and sign off in triplicate. This enables small groups to execute exceptionally fast. 

##A Team, Not a Family

> Adequate performance gets a generous severance package

Netflix sees themselves as a professional sports team whose leadership hires, develops, and cuts smartly so they have **stars in every position**. By constantly refining their team to ensure they employ the best of the best they are able to **increase their talent density** over time. Performance is measured solely by production, not how many hours worked or time spent in the office. 

> Sustained B-level performance, despite "A for effort", generates a generous severance package, with respect.
> Sustained A-level performance, despite minimal effort, is rewarded with more responsibility and great pay.

Loyalty is seen as a stabilizer -- Netflix is loyal to employees with occasional bad patches as it expected that employees would be loyal to Netflix for the same. Hard work is seen as irrelevant -- results are king. Brilliant jerks are not tolerated -- cost to effective teamwork far outweighs individual production.

Talent is retained with aggressive compensation reevaluated yearly and adjusted to position-based top-of-market so there is no incentive to leave for another company simply for a higher paycheck -- it doesn't exist. Talent retention is also self-fulfilling as Netflix's culture is based around excellence of colleagues so those they hire are those that *want* to work with great people; keeping great people around keeps other great people around. 

##The Rare Responsible Person

Responsible people **thrive** on freedom and are **worth** of freedom. The _Rare Responsible Person_ is: self motivating, self aware, self disciplined, self improving, acts like a leader, doesn't wait to be told what to do, picks up the trash lying on the floor. Imposing process restricts the freedom of responsible people, causing stress, unhappiness, and eventual exodus. 

Preservation of freedom is paramount in retaining the best talent, but how how do you retain freedom as the company grows and the product becomes increasingly more complex?

It comes back to **talent density**.

By ensuring a steady talent growth which outpaces business growth, responsible individuals are able to cope with complexity naturally. A key to this, however, is to **minimize complexity growth** by focusing on many small products instead of a monolithic architecture. Distracting complexity is eliminated and "efficiency optimizations" which **increase rigidity** are avoided.

##Collected Notes

**Values are what we Value**

- We Seek Excellence
- Actual company values shown by who gets _rewarded_, _promoted_ or _let go_
- Actual company values are the _behaviors_ and _skills_ that are _valued_ in fellow employees
  - Judgement, Communication, Impact, Curiosity, Innovation, Courage, Passion, Honesty, Selflessness
- Great workplace === stunning colleagues, not lush benefits, catered lunches, etc.

**Performance trumps all**

> Adequate performance gets a generous severance package

- We're a _team_, not a family. We're like a **pro sports team** not a kid's recreational team.

> The Managers' **Keeper Test**
> - Which of my people, if they told me were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would i fight hard to keep at Netflix? 
> - The others people should get a generous severance now, so we can open a slot to try to find a star for that role

- However, corporate team roster is fluid (unlike sports team) so internal "cutthroat" or "sink or swim" behavior is rare and not tolerated
- Loyalty is Good as a stabilizer
  - People who have been stars, and hit a bad patch, get a near-term pass because they can be stars again
  - They expect he same: if Netflix hits a _temporary_ bad patch, people should stick it out
  - But unlimited loyalty to a shrinking firm, or to an ineffective employee, is not what we are about
  
> Sustained B-level performance, despite "A for effort", generates a generous severance package, with respect
> Sustained A-level performance, despite minimal effort, is rewarded with more responsibility and great pay

- **Brilliant Jerks** are not tolerated because cost to effective teamwork is too high.
- Insistence on performance because, in procedural work, the best are **2x** better than the average, but in creative work, the best are **10x** better than the average. 
- The Rare Responsible Person is: self motivating, self aware, self disciplined, self improving, acts like a leader, doesn't wait to be told what to do, picks up the trash lying on the floor
- Responsible people **thrive** on freedom and are **worthy** of freedom

Why companies impose process as they grow
![netflix chaos](/assets/netflix_chaos.jpg)

- Growth naturally causes complexity, but often shrinks talent density as need to "staff up quickly" erodes traditional hiring practices
- Process emerges to corral chaos, providing seductive near-term order
- Process optimizes practices for **existing** market and customers
- Process drives out "curious innovator-mavericks", driving talent density even lower
- **Then market shifts...**
- Low talent density and lack of innovators prevent company from adapting quick enough
- Company grinds painfully into irrelevance

How to avoid the **Process Solution**: 
![netflix growth](/assets/netflix_chaos_free.jpg)

**How to:** Retain talent density

- Offer top-of-market compensation
- Attract high-value people through freedom to make big impact
- Be demanding about high performance culture

**How to:** Minimize complexity growth

- Few big products vs. many small ones
- Eliminate distracting complexity
- Be wary of efficiency optimizations that increase complexity and rigidity

> Sometimes long-term simplicity is achieved only through bursts of complexity to rework current systems

- **Rapid recovery > error prevention**
  - High performers make very few errors
  - Not a safety-critical market so doesn't matter
  - As long as errors are not **moral**, **legal**, or **financial**

- **Good** process helps talented people get more done
  - Letting others know when you are updating code
  - Spend within budget each quarter 
  - Regularly scheduled strategy and context meetings
- **Bad** process tries to prevent recoverable mistakes
  - Get pre-approvals for $5k spending
  - 3 people to sign off on banner ad creative
  - Permission to hang a poster on a wall
  - Multi-level approval process for projects
  - Get 10 people to interview each candidate

- Spending, vacation, etc. policy simply:

> Act in Netflix's Best Interest

**Context, Not Control** 

**Do:**
Strategy, metrics, assumptions, objectives, clearly-defined roles, knowledge of the stakes, transparency around decision-making

**Don't:**
Top-down decision-making, management approval, committees, planning and process valued more than results

**Good Context**
- Link to company / functional goals
- Relative priority
  - Critical (needs to happen now), or ...
  - Nice to have (when you can get to it)
- Level of precision & refinement expected
  - No errors (credit card handling)
  - Pretty good; errors can be corrected (website)
  - Rough / experimental / POC
- Key stakeholders
- Key metrics / definition of success

> Mangers: When one of your talented people does something dumb, **don't blame them**. Instead, ask yourself **what context you failed to set**.

Corporate culture: **Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled**

- Highly Aligned
  - Strategy and goals are clear, specific, broadly understood
  - Team interactions focused on strategy and goals, rather than tactics
  - Requires large investment in management time to be transparent and articulate and perceptive
- Loosely Coupled
  - Minimal cross-functional meetings except to get aligned on goals and strategy
  - Trust between groups on tactics without previewing / approving each one -- so groups can move fast
  - Leaders reaching out proactively for ad-hoc coordination and perspective as appropriate
  - Occasional post-mortems on tactics necessary to increase alignment

- Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled teamwork effectiveness depends on **high performance** people and **good context**
- Goal is to be **Big** and **Fast** and **Flexible**

**Top-of-market pay attracts and retains top-of-market people**

- Goal is to keep each employee at top of market _for that person_
  - Pay them more than anyone else likely would
  - Pay them as much as a replacement would cost
  - Pay them as much as we would pay to keep them if they had a higher offer from elsewhere

- Comp re-evaluated each year with **all** above aspects re-evaluated
- Always role / talent specific to market, like stocks, not from global raise pool
  - If mobile is hot this year, mobile developers may get bigger raises than server
- Comp not dependent on Netflix success
  - Sports teams with losing records still pay talent market rate **to get back to winning**

**Bad Compensation Practices**
- Manager sets pay to Nth percentile of title-linked compensation data
  - not all "Major League Pitchers" are equally good
- Manager cares about internal parity instead of external market value
  - Fairness in comp is being true to market
- Manager gives everyone a 4% raise
  - Very unlikely to reflect market

- Employees encouraged to investigate and understand their own market value by interviewing and discussing with peers
  - Bring findings back to manager
- Big salary more important than matching or bonuses
- Employees decide how much stock v. cash they want
- No vesting or deferred comp
  - Managers should not own people
  - People should stay because they want to, not because they're "resting and vesting"

- No formal "career planning"
- Development is self-motivated by being surrounded with stunning colleagues and big challenging work
- Promotions happen if:
  1. Job is big enough
  2. Superstore in current role
  3. Person is an extraordinary role model of our culture and values
